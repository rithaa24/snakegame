# AI Snake Game with Reinforcement Learning

This repository contains a Python implementation of the classic Snake game, where the snake is controlled by a reinforcement learning (RL) agent. The RL agent is trained using Q-learning to play the game optimally.

## Introduction

The Snake game is a popular arcade game where the player controls a snake that moves around the screen, eating food and growing longer. The objective is to avoid colliding with the walls or itself while maximizing the length of the snake.

In this project, we use reinforcement learning to train an AI agent to play the Snake game. Specifically, we employ Q-learning, a model-free RL algorithm, to learn an optimal policy for controlling the snake.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- `numpy`
- `pygame`
- `matplotlib` (for plotting training results)

You can install the required packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install numpy pygame matplotlib
```

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-snake-game.git
    cd ai-snake-game
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

To run the Snake game with a pre-trained agent, use the following command:

```bash
python play_snake.py
```

If you want to train a new agent from scratch, use:

```bash
python train_agent.py
```

This will start the training process and save the trained model to a file.

## Training the Agent

The training process involves running the Snake game in a loop where the agent learns from its actions using the Q-learning algorithm. The training script `train_agent.py` handles the setup and execution of this process.

### Parameters

You can configure the training parameters in `train_agent.py`:

- `epsilon`: The exploration rate, which determines the balance between exploration and exploitation.
- `alpha`: The learning rate for Q-value updates.
- `gamma`: The discount factor for future rewards.
- `episodes`: The number of episodes for training.

Adjust these parameters as needed to fine-tune the training process.

## Results

After training, you can visualize the performance of the agent by running:

```bash
python plot_results.py
```

This script generates plots showing the agent's performance over time, including metrics like average reward and length of the snake.
